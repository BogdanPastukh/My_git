        <p><h4>  I am bracing myself for the incoming fury of guys who graduated high school in 1996, but I’m just going to come out and say it: Nirvana ruined rock & roll.</h4></p>
            <p>Every couple of years I check out their catalog again. Every couple of years I’m left with the same impression: Bleach has a couple good tracks but is mostly forgettable. Kurt Cobain was right — Nevermind basically sounds like a Mötley Crüe record (in a bad way). Incesticide contains the cream of the band’s work, but I usually end up listening to the covers and skipping the rest. In Utero has some cool solos but is otherwise noisy, unlistenable garbage. Ultimately, there’s not a single Nirvana record I would voluntarily choose to put on.

Hold on. The nuance is coming.</p>

            <p><h4>  Prose
Deep Purple has surrendered to the ‘Rapture’; now it’s your turn
By Jeff Miers </h4></p>
            <p> The first time I heard Deep Purple – or perhaps felt Deep Purple is a better way to describe the experience – it was the mid-70s. I was 8, and Ritchie Blackmore’s sinewy, sinister riffing on the “Made In Japan” version of “Child In Time,” coupled with Ian Gillan’s dramatic, gorgeous howling, Jon Lord’s ominous neo-classical Hammond organ, and the dynamic interplay of the Roger Glover-Ian Paice rhythm section, tore the top of my head off.

It was unlike anything else I’d ever heard. And it quite literally changed my life. 30 years later, I’m still hearing Deep Purple for the first time.

“Rapture of the Deep” is the spot-on moniker for the disc you hold in your hands, and I’ll stand on any classic rock radio programmer’s desk in my cowboy boots and scream it loud, proud and Gillan-esque; “This is the best Deep Purple album there is, dammit! Forget ‘Machine Head’ – that was then; this is most decidedly now!” </p>

            <p><h4>  10 Best Reissues of 2016 </h4></p>
            <p>There is, amidst the ongoing doom and gloom, a literal growth industry in the record business: history. Reissues are coming in bigger physical sizes and grander retrospective scope, to the boon of collector-maniacs and at the expense of most wallets. But size is not everything. This survey of the 10 best archaeological releases of 2016 runs the weight scale from the truly spectacular – the audio-visual excavation of Pink Floyd's psychedelic and experimental eras – to single-disc concentrations of previously-unknown work by crucial, then-emerging voices. The result: something for every budget and obsession.</p>

            <p><h4>  PINK FLOYD RECORDS REINTRODUCE 'THE FINAL CUT' AND 'A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON' ON VINYL </h4></p>
            <p>On Friday 20th January 2017, Pink Floyd Records will complete the reintroduction of the Pink Floyd studio albums on vinyl with The Final Cut and A Momentary Lapse of Reason remastered and reissued. These albums have not been available on vinyl for well over two decades.

Over the past year, Pink Floyd Records has released the entire studio collection as stereo remastered versions on heavyweight 180g vinyl. All are mastered from the original analogue studio tapes with album artwork faithfully reproduced.

Released originally in 1983, The Final Cut was another global chart-topper for Pink Floyd. During the Falklands War and the era of Thatcherism, this anti-war concept album explored the themes of fallen servicemen, the loss of loved ones and political betrayal.

A Momentary Lapse of Reason, Pink Floyd's thirteenth studio album, was released in 1987 and demonstrated a significant change in style for the band with more experimental use of drum machines and samples. The album also saw the return of graphic artist Storm Thorgerson who designed this now iconic cover.
